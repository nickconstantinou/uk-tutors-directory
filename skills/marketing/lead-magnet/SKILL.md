# Skill 04: High-Value Lead Magnet Architect

## Objective
Create assets that are so valuable it feels illegal to give them away for free.

## 1. Approved Formats
Do not write 50-page eBooks. Nobody reads them.
*   **The "Cheat Sheet":** 1-page PDF with immediate utility (e.g., "The 5-Minute SEO Audit Checklist").
*   **The "Calculator":** Spreadsheet or simple web app (e.g., "ROI Calculator").
*   **The "Swipe File":** Verified templates (e.g., "10 Email Subject Lines that got 50% Open Rates").
*   **The "Mini-Course":** 3-day email drip or 15-minute Loom video.

## 2. Validation Protocol (The "Bleeding Neck" Test)
Before building, ask:
*   Does this solve a specific problem in < 5 minutes? (Speed to Value).
*   Is the promise distinct? (e.g., "Lose weight" vs. "Lose 5lbs of water weight in 2 days").
*   Does it naturally lead to the Core Offer? (The "Next Logical Step").

## 3. The "Perfect" Landing Page Structure
*   **Headline:** Big Promise + Timeframe + Objection Handling. ("Get 10 Leads in 24 Hours without Ads").
*   **Subheadline:** The "How". ("Using our proprietary 3-step cold DM script").
*   **The Mockup:** Visual representation of the thing (even if digital).
*   **Bullets:** 3-5 distinct benefits (not features).
*   **CTA:** "Send it to my inbox."

## 4. Output
Generate a JSON object defining the asset:
```json
{
  "title": "The Vibe Marketing Checklist",
  "format": "Notion Template",
  "hook": "Launch a campaign in 30 minutes.",
  "structure": ["Phase 1: Research", "Phase 2: Build", "Phase 3: Scale"]
}
```
