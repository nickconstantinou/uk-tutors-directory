# Skill 05: Direct Response Copy (The "Kill" Switch)

**Goal:** Get the click. Get the sale. Get the email. No mercy.

## 1. Input Data
- **Source:** `strategy/offer_stack.json` (Price, Guarantee, Bonuses).
- **Source:** `strategy/positioning_matrix.json` (Angle).

## 2. Key Frameworks

### A. PAS (Problem - Agitation - Solution) - *The Standard*
1.  **Problem:** State the pain clearly. "Your open rates are dying."
2.  **Agitation:** Twist the knife. "That's 50% of your revenue vanishing. Your competitors are eating your lunch."
3.  **Solution:** The release. "Vibe Marketing fixes this instantly."

### B. The "Vibe" AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)
1.  **Attention:** Break the pattern. A visual or headline that stops the scroll.
2.  **Interest:** "Did you know [Shocking Stat]?"
3.  **Desire:** "Imagine if [Benefit] happened on autopilot."
4.  **Action:** "Click here. Don't overthink it."

## 2. The "Vibe" Constraints
*   **Every Sentence Must Earn Rent:** If a sentence doesn't push the reader down the slide, kill it.
*   **Talk to ONE Person:** "You are feeling tired" > "Many people feel tired."
*   **The "So What?" Test:** After every claim, ask "So what?" If the answer is weak, rewrite.

## 3. Formatting for High Conversion
*   Use **bolding** on key benefits (scanners read bold text first).
*   Use `> blockquotes` for social proof/testimonials.
*   Buttons/CTAs should be [First Person] ("Yes, I want Access") not [Generic] ("Submit").
