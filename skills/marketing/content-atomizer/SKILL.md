# Skill 09: Content Atomization (The Redistribution Engine)

**Goal:** Turn one high-value asset (Landing Page, Blog Post) into 15+ native social pieces. **Do not summarize.** Translate.

## 1. The "Native" Adapters

### A. Twitter/X Thread (The "Value Skim")
*   **Constraint:** 280 chars max per tweet.
*   **Hook (Tweet 1):** Must be clickbait-adjacent but honest. "I just realized X. Here's the breakdown 🧵"
*   **Body:** One idea per tweet. Use emojis sparingly as bullet points.
*   **The Close:** "If you liked this, drop a follow. I write about [Topic]."

### B. LinkedIn Post (The "Broetry" Remix)
*   **Constraint:** Mobile-optimized spacing. One sentence per line max.
*   **The "Contrarian" Angle:** Take a point from the source text and flip it. "Everyone thinks X. They are wrong. Here is why."
*   **Call to Comment:** "Agree or disagree?" (Drive engagement).

### C. Instagram/Threads Carousel (The "Visual" Story)
*   **Slide 1:** Big, bold Typography Headline.
*   **Slide 2-4:** The "How-To" or "The List".
*   **Last Slide:** "Save this for later."

## 2. The Golden Rule
**Never output "Here is a summary of the post."**
The output must look like it was written *natively* for that platform by a chaotic-good founder.

## 3. Formatting
*   Output each asset in a separate code block tagged with the platform name.
*   Include image generation prompts for visual assets using the `generate_image` tool style syntax.
