# Skill 02: Positioning Architect

## Objective
To find the empty space in the market where you can be the only logical choice.

## 1. The "4 U's" Framework
Every angle must hit at least 3:
*   **Urgent:** Why now? (The problem is getting worse).
*   **Unique:** Why you? (The mechanism is new).
*   **Useful:** What do I get? (The benefit is clear).
*   **Ultra-Specific:** Who is it for? (The avatar is defined).

## 2. Advanced Angles
*   **The "Mechanism" Angle:** "Everyone uses [Old Mechanism], but it fails because [Reason]. We use [New Mechanism]."
*   **The "Identity" Angle:** "Smart founders don't do X; they do Y."
*   **The "Enemy" Angle:** "It's not your fault [Big Corp] lied to you."

## 3. The "Blue Ocean" Canvas
Map the competition on these axes:
*   *Price:* Low vs. High.
*   *Complexity:* DIY vs. Done-for-you.
*   *Vibe:* Corporate vs.Human.

## 4. Output: The Positioning Matrix
Generate a JSON file:
```json
{
  "market_gap": "High-end design for low-tech founders.",
  "primary_angle": "The 'Apple' of Email Marketing.",
  "hook": "Stop sending ugly emails.",
  "enemy": "Mailchimp (too complex) and Substack (too simple)."
}
```
