# Skill 07: Recurring Revenue Newsletter

## Objective
Build a relationship asset that prints money on demand, independent of algorithms.

## 1. Core Formats
Rotate these to keep the list engaged.
*   **The "Deep Dive":** 1,000+ words on a single topic. (Status: Expert).
    *   *Structure:* Hook -> The "Old Way" -> The "New Way" -> Implementation.
*   **The "Curated Mix":** 1 Big Idea + 3 Links + 1 Tool. (Status: Reporter).
    *   *Structure:* "What I'm thinking about" -> "What I'm reading" -> "What I'm using."
*   **The "Contrarian Rant":** Attack a common industry belief. (Status: Thought Leader).
    *   *Structure:* "Everyone says X" -> "Why X is a lie" -> "Here is the truth."

## 2. The Subject Line Algorithm
Must hit 2 of 3: Curiosity, Benefit, Urgency.
*   *Curiosity:* "About last night..."
*   *Benefit:* "How I saved $4k this week"
*   *Urgency:* "Last chance (for real)"

## 3. The "Click" Rule
Every newsletter must have ONE primary goal.
*   *Bad:* "Read this, buy this, follow me here, look at this cat."
*   *Good:* "Read this story -> Click to watch the video."

## 4. Protocol for Writing
1.  **Draft:** Use `brand-voice.md`.
2.  **Review:** Ensure the "Preview Text" (the snippet seen in inbox) complements the subject line.
3.  **Link Check:** Verify all links works.
4.  **Send:** Tuesday or Thursday, 10 AM local time.
