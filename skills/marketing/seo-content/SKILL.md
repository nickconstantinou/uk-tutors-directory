# Skill 06: Human-Centric SEO (The Anti-Slop Protocol)

**Goal:** Rank high without sounding like a robot. Google rewards "Information Gain," not keyword stuffing.

## 1. The Anti-AI Filter (Mandatory)
Before writing a single word, run this mental `grep`. If these words appear, delete the sentence and start over:
*   *Banned:* "Delve", "Landscape", "Tapestry", "Robust", "Leverage", "Synergy", "Transformative", "In conclusion".
*   *Replacement:* Use Anglo-Saxon roots. "Use" instead of "Utilize". "Fix" instead of "Remediate".

## 2. Structure: The "Hook & Hold"
*   **H1 (The Promise):** Must contain the primary keyword + a benefit.
*   **The First 100 Words (The Hook):** NO FLUFF. No "In today's fast-paced digital world..." garbage.
    *   *Bad:* "SEO is important for businesses..."
    *   *Good:* "Most SEO advice is trash. Here’s why your traffic is flatlining and how to fix it in 10 minutes."
*   **H2s (The Pillars):** Answer the specific query. Don't be cute. Be clear.

## 3. Vibe Constraints
*   **Sentence Variance:**
    *   Short sentence.
    *   Another short one.
    *   Then a longer, more flowing sentence to create a rhythm that pulls the reader down the page like a slide.
*   **Active Voice Only:** "The code was written by the agent" -> "The agent wrote the code."
*   **Opinion is King:** Neutral content is dead content. Take a stance. If a tool sucks, say it sucks.

## 4. Output Format
*   Use `###` for sub-points.
*   Use `> [!TIP]` for "Vibe Checks" or insider tips.
*   Link internally to related "Vibe" assets.
