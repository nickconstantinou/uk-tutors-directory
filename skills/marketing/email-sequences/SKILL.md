# Skill 08: The Conversion Engine (Email)

## Objective
To build automated email sequences that convert attention into revenue without being annoying.

## 1. Sequence Architectures

### A. The "Soap Opera" Welcome (5 Days)
*   **Day 1: The Stage Setter.** "Here's what you requested, plus a warning." (Deliver Lead Magnet).
*   **Day 2: High Drama.** "I almost quit..." (Backstory/Vulnerability).
*   **Day 3: Epiphany.** "...then I realized X was the problem." (The Pivot).
*   **Day 4: Hidden Benefits.** "People think it's for Y, but it's actually for Z." (Education).
*   **Day 5: The Urgency.** "This goes away soon." (Soft Pitch).

### B. The "Seinfeld" Nurture (Indefinite)
*   **Concept:** Emails about "nothing" that relate back to the product.
*   **Ratio:** 3 Value Emails : 1 Offer Email.
*   **Topics:** Current events, personal stories, weird observations.

### C. The "Sidewalk" Launch (7 Days)
*   **Days 1-3:** The Logic (Features, Logic, Reason).
*   **Days 4-5:** The Emotion (Fear, Status, Belonging).
*   **Days 6-7:** The Scarcity (Timer, Bonuses Disappearing).

### D. The "Cart Recovery" Sniper (4 Hours)
*   **Hour 1:** "Did Wi-Fi die?" (Helpful, no pressure).
*   **Hour 24:** "Saved your cart." (Reminder).
*   **Hour 48:** "Here is a reason to finish." (Social Proof, NOT discount).

## 2. Formatting Rules
*   **Subject Lines:** Lowercase, casual, curiosity-inducing. (e.g., "quick question", "bad news", "re: your account").
*   **Body:** 
    *   Max 600 pixels wide.
    *   14pt+ font size.
    *   One link per email (usually).
    *   P.S. always contains a secondary hook or link.

## 3. Protocol
1.  **Define Goal:** What is the ONE action? (Click, Reply, Buy).
2.  **Draft:** Write using `brand-voice.md`.
3.  **Refine:** Check against "Spam Trigger Words" (free, guarantee, $$$).
4.  **Output:** JSON structure with `subject`, `preview_text`, `body_html`, `send_delay`.
