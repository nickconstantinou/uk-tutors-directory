# Skill 11: Creative Director

## Objective
To define the visual DNA of the campaign before a single pixel is generated.

## 1. Aesthetic Archetypes
Choose one. Do not mix.
*   **Neo-Brutalist:** High contrast, courier fonts, raw unstyled HTML elements, colliding colors. (Vibe: Tech, Developer, Counter-culture).
*   **Lux-Minimal:** Lots of whitespace, serif fonts (Inter/Playfair), black & white photography. (Vibe: High-ticket, Exclusive).
*   **Retro-Futurism:** Grainy 90s anime aesthetic, neon purples/pinks, CRT monitor effects. (Vibe: Web3, Gaming, Nostalgia).
*   **Corporate Clean:** Sans-serif, reliable blues, stock photos of people shaking hands. **BANNED.**

## 2. Color Psychology
*   **Black/White:** Luxury, Authority, timelessness.
*   **Orange/Red:** Urgency, Cheap, Discount.
*   **Blue:** Trust, Stability (Boring).
*   **Neon Green:** Growth, Money, Tech-forward.

## 3. The Creative Brief Protocol

  "typography": ["Courier New", "Helvetica Bold"],
  "motif": "Glitch art and raw concrete textures."
}
```

## 4. Banned Visuals
