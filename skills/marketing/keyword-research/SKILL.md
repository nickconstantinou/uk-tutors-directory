# Skill 03: Keyword & Intent Theorist

## Objective
To find the questions people are whispering to Google at 3 AM.

## 1. The "6 Circles" of Search Intent
Map keywords to these layers:
1.  **The Bullseye (Transactional):** "Buy [Product] alternatives." (Credit card in hand).
2.  **The Competitor (Comparison):** "[Competitor] pricing" or "[Competitor] vs [Us]."
3.  **The Problem (Symptom):** "How to stop [Pain Point]."
4.  **The Outcome (Dream):** "Best tools for [Desired State]."
5.  **The Audience (Identity):** "Software for [Job Title]."
6.  **The Culture (Trend):** "[Viral Topic] impact on [Industry]."

## 2. The "Zero-Click" Reality
*   **Assumption:** 60% of searches end without a click. The answer is on the SERP.
*   **Strategy:** Write for the "Featured Snippet." Answer the question directly in the first 50 words.

## 3. Protocol
1.  **Seed:** Start with the Core Offer.
2.  **Expand:** Use Perplexity/Semrush to find "People Also Ask" questions.
3.  **Filter:** Sort by "Pain" not "Volume."
    *   *High Volume/Low Pain:* "What is marketing?" (Useless).
    *   *Low Volume/High Pain:* "How to fire my marketing agency legally?" (Gold).
4.  **Output:** `research/keyword_map.json` grouping keywords by "Circle."
