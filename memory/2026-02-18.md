## What We Did

### ExamPulse Marketing Site
- Added nav with Quiz | Blog links
- Removed "Nick's Blog" link (separate project, never mix)
- Fixed nav styling with frontend-design skill

### Crawl4AI
- Created crawl4ai skill at `/skills/crawl4ai/`
- Integrated into content-crawler skill
- Integrated into marketing researcher skill
- Added to marketing skills folder

### CMO Sub-Agent
- Created sub-agent definition at `.subagents/cmo/AGENT.md`
- Copied 18 marketing skills from antigravity repo to `/skills/marketing/`
- Still need: enable sub-agent spawning in OpenClaw config

### Learning (Self-Learning)
- Always verify deployed pages work (screenshot/curl)
- Separate projects = no cross-links
- Use frontend-design skill for UI features
- Remember what Nick asks once — don't repeat

## Issues to Fix Later
- ~~Crawl4AI Docker~~ - Use Jina AI Reader instead (curl works now!)
  - Jina: `curl -s "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com"`
- Need to configure sub-agent allowlist for CMO

## UK Tutors Directory
- GitHub repo created: nickconstantinou/uk-tutors-directory
- Files: index.html, list.html, README.md (pure HTML/CSS/JS)
- GitHub Pages enabled but returning 404
- Issue: Token lacks `workflow` scope - can't push workflow files
- Solution: Created deploy.yml locally but Nick needs to commit manually, OR re-enable Pages in settings
- Site should be at: https://nickconstantinou.github.io/uk-tutors-directory/
- Wait 1-2 mins after enabling Pages

## Today's Update (Feb 18, 17:56)
- Outscraper skill updated with correct API details:
  - Endpoint: `https://api.outscraper.cloud` (NOT .com!)
  - Auth: Header `X-API-KEY: YOUR_KEY`
  - Nick has the Outscraper OpenAPI spec document to get API key from dashboard
- Ready to scrape tutor data once Nick provides API key

## Full Session Update (Feb 18, 19:00)
### What worked:
1. **Outscraper** - Scraped 35 tutors from Northampton area using Google Maps API
2. **Jina AI enrichment** - Used `curl -s "https://r.jina.ai/https://..."` to extract:
   - Subjects (Maths, English, Physics, Chemistry)
   - Levels (KS2, KS3, KS4, GCSE, A-Level)
   - Pricing where available
   - Trial offers
   - Online/In-person format

### Supabase Issues & Fixes:
1. **Old service key didn't work** - Got new `sbp_...` format key from Nick
2. **Schema not exposed** - Tables in `uk_tutors` schema couldn't be accessed via REST API
3. **Fix:** Moved tables to public schema: `ALTER TABLE uk_tutors.tutors SET SCHEMA public;`
4. **Key learning:** Supabase has TWO APIs:
   - REST API: `https://{ref}.supabase.co/rest/v1/` (uses anon key)
   - Management API: `https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{ref}/database/query` (uses service key)

### UK Tutors Directory:
- **Live at:** https://nickconstantinou.github.io/uk-tutors-directory/
- **18 tutors** in Supabase with enriched data
- **Site fetches from Supabase** - working!
- **Skills updated** with all lessons learned

### Skills Created/Updated:
- `/skills/supabase/SKILL.md` - Complete guide with troubleshooting
- `/skills/outscraper/SKILL.md` - Corrected API endpoint
- `/skills/credentials/SKILL.md` - How to store keys

## Evening Session (Feb 18, 21:45)
### Lead Flow Fix
- UK Tutors site was querying `uk_tutors/tutors` but tables moved to public schema
- Fixed: Changed to `tutors` and `leads` (no schema prefix)
- Pushed fix: site now fetches real tutor data from Supabase ✅
- Lead capture form submits to `leads` table - tested and working

### ExamPulse TS Errors
- Fixed relative imports in `_layout.tsx` (@/src/* → ../src/*)
- Remaining pre-existing errors: expo-linear-gradient types, tabs layout
- PR #4 ready to merge
